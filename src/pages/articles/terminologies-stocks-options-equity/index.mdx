## _What‚Äôs a stock?_

If you‚Äôre new to trading and try to read the news, you‚Äôll often find articles dealing with **stocks**. I didn‚Äôt know that when people say stock, they usually refer to **common stocks**, as opposed to **preferred stocks**. Yes, there are two types of stocks. To understand how they differ, let‚Äôs first understand what‚Äôs a stock.

‚ÄúA stock is **a security that represents the ownership of a fraction of a corporation**.‚Äù[1] Nowadays, companies issue thousands, millions or even billions of shares (for more info read [1]).

### Right, so what‚Äôs the difference between common and preferred stocks?

By owning common stocks, one can benefit from:

- A portion of the company profits as **dividends** if the company distributes them.
- The ability to **vote** on decisions related to the company (as opposed to owning a preferred stock). i.e. can vote on who should be the company‚Äôs board of directors.
- A portion of remaining **assets** in case of **liquidation**.

By owning preferred stocks, one can benefit from:

- A **fixed** amount of **income** each year
- Being **paid before common stockholders** get paid dividends

> ‚ÄúDividends are payments a company makes to share profits with its stockholders. They‚Äôre paid on a regular basis, and they are one of the ways investors earn a return from investing in a stock.‚Äù[2]
>
> ‚ÄúLiquidation is the process of bringing a business to an end and distributing its assets to claimants‚Äù[3]

Generally speaking, the main benefit of owning a stock is making money from its value fluctuations in the market. The return on the investment, in this case, is called _capital gains_.

## Options

> ‚Äú**Options** are financial derivatives¬π that give the buyer the right to buy or sell the underlying asset¬≤ at a stated price¬≥ within a specified period.‚Äù[4]
>
> ¬π Options are considered financial derivatves because their value is dependant on the price of a corresponding asset.  
> ¬≤ The asset could be: stocks, bonds, currency, interest rates, market indices, exchange-traded funds (ETFs) or futures contracts [5]  
> ¬≥ The stated price is also called the _strike price_.

In this article, we consider the 4 following types of options: calls, puts, American and European options.

**Call** **options**: give the right to buy at the strike price.

**Put** **options**: give the right to sell at a fixed price.

**American options**: give the right to exercise\* the option at the strike price any time up to the expiration date.

**European options**: give the right to exercise\* the option at the expiration date, but not earlier.

_\* In options trading, the option holder has the right, but not the obligation to buy or sell the option, hence the name ‚Äúoption‚Äù. ‚ÄúExercising the option‚Äù means to buy or sell the option._

## Forwards and Futures

For both forwards and futures contracts, a buyer and seller agree to trade assets at a strike price on a future date.

On the one hand, futures are standardized contracts traded on futures exchanges. It is a contract that obligates the buyer to buy or the seller to sell an asset at a predetermined price at a specified time in the future.

On the other hand, forwards are non-standardized contracts privately negotiated between the two parties. Forwards are not designed to be traded on an exchange.

## Equity

Public equity refers to stocks traded in a stock exchange, whereas private equity refers to shares of a company that cannot be traded on a stock market.
